To package a Python application for AWS Lambda, I would first create a new bucket for deployment artifacts by running the `1-create-bucket.sh` script. Then, I would build a Lambda layer that contains the function's runtime dependencies using the `2-build-layer.sh` script. This reduces the size of the deployment package I'll upload later. Finally, I would deploy the application using the `3-deploy.sh` script, which uses AWS CloudFormation.
